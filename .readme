# Project Name: Furniture Classification
This project is focused on classifying images of furniture into three categories: sofa, bed, and chair. The project is built using Python, FAST api and deep learning libraries like torch .

# Docker
To ensure that the code runs smoothly on any system, we have provided a Dockerfile for the project. To use Docker, follow these steps:
    Install Docker on your system.
    Navigate to the project directory.

    Build the Docker image using the following command: docker build -t furniture_classification .
    Run the Docker container using the following command: docker run -it -p 8888:8888 furniture_classification

docker compose up -d
docker compose down
This will launch a Jupyter notebook server that you can access by navigating to localhost:8888 in your browser.

# Code Structure
The project code is structured as follows:
lua
|-- .github/workflows
|   |-- main.yml/
|-- data/
|   |-- testing_dataset/
|   |-- training_dataset/
|-- models/
|   |-- models.pth
|-- notebooks/
# |   |-- data_exploration.ipynb
|   |-- trainings.ipynb
|-- src/
|   |-- experiment.py
|   |-- main.py
|   |-- model_runner.py
|-- README.md
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- Dockerfile
|-- requirements.txt

The data/ directory contains two subdirectories: train/ and val/. These directories contain the training and validation datasets, respectively.

The models/ directory contains pre-trained models that can be used for prediction.
The notebooks/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
The src/ directory contains the Python source code for the project. data.py contains functions for loading and preprocessing data. model.py contains the architecture of the deep learning model. predict.py contains functions for making predictions. train.py contains functions for training the model.
The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the project.
The README.md file contains information about the project and how to use it.
The requirements.txt file lists the Python packages required to run the project.

Running the Code
# To run the code, follow these steps:
    Clone the repository to your local system.
    Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Download the training and validation datasets and place them in the data/train/ and data/val/ directories, respectively.
    Run the train.py script to train the model.
    Use the predict.py script to make predictions on new images.

# Conclusion
This project provides a simple and efficient way to classify images of furniture using deep learning techniques. With the Docker container, users can run the code on any system without worrying about dependencies. The code structure is designed to be modular and easy to understand, making it easy to modify for other image classification tasks.
